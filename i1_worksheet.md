Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the
feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit
that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

For our work on this project, we decided to use the Git Flow branching strategy, to our best efforts.

As seen in the screenshot below of our git log, each member of the group creating a new branch in order
to work on the feature they were working on, and pushed changes to their own branch as they made progress.
Every couple of days, our group members would then meet and merge changes into a "merge" branch, and then
when everyone's changes had been merged, that "merge" branch would be merged into main. We then created new
branches from main afterwards and repeated the process.

SOLID
-----

Looking through the project file from  [Group 11] (https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-10/sport-box-score-manager). We found out there is a single responsibility principle violation in  ScoreActivity.class ScoreActivity includes adding and subtraction within this UI layer class.

Agile Planning
--------------

Write a paragraph about any plans that were changed. Did you
'push' any features to iteration 2? Did you change the description
of any Features or User Stories? Have links to any changed or pushed Features
or User Stories.
