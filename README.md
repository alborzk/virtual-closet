# Virtual Closet

## About
VirtualCloset is a simple, flexible, and easy-to-use organisational tool. You wear clothes every day, and between a closet, dresser, laundry basket, washing machine, that chair in your room that accumulates clothes that you’ve worn once but don’t need to be washed yet, it's easy to lose track of parts of your wardrobe. On top of that, it can be difficult to come up with outfits that are stylish in the mornings before your busy day.

Our app can help you stay on top of your wardrobe and be your most fashionable self. It lets you keep track of all the items in your closet, from sneakers to sundresses to sweaters. Your clothes can be further categorised by their attributes, like colour or season. VirtualCloset also lets you combine items into outfits to keep track of your best style ideas.

## Getting Started
- Launch the apk either through an Android device or Android emulator to get started.
-  If you just want to see what the app has to offer, you can log in with the default account using the username 'user' and the password 'password'. 
-  Otherwise, you can create an account and get started with your own Virtual Closet.

*Please note: Virtual Closet is currently built for and optimized for use with a Nexus 7 tablet.*
