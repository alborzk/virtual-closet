        What's In Your Closet?
    </h1>
    <p>The value of this project is in its function as an organizational tool, allowing people to see all of the clothes they own, without manually digging through their clothes. Virtual Closet will provide our users with the experience of having a walk-in closet, without requiring them to own an expensive home with one included. It provides an experience that was previously only available to the wealthy, and puts into the hands of everyone. The system is also valuable because everyone wears clothes meaning our system is applicable to all people, but not everyone has proper organization for their wardrobe, so our system solves that problem as well. Furthermore, this is a useful application because there aren’t very many similar apps meaning we provide a unique service to our users.</p>

<!--Vision Statement and Target Audience-->

                <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                <p>Virtual Closet is an app that allows people to view and organize the clothes and outfits in their closet from their mobile device. The app will organize the user’s clothing and outfits by categories such as style, colour, and seasonal trends. The app allows users to create outfits based on clothes in their virtual closet, and helps them design their outfits with recommendations and suggestions about complementary colours.</p>
                <p>The system is currently being designed as a mobile application, so people will be able to create, manage, or view their virtual closet, from anywhere they go.</p>
                <p>The project will be considered successful based on two criteria. First, we will measure user activity on the app over a prolonged period of time. If our users develop a habit of using our app, that must mean we’ve provided a useful service. However, if they only try the app a few times, that must mean they prefer using existing solutions to our app. This usage statistic will help us understand the usefulness of the app to the average user. The second criteria we will measure is how robust our organizational tools are, based on surveys provided to our users. Because more dedicated users are the ones most likely to respond to surveys, this metric will show us how our expert users responded to our app.</p>            </div>
            <div class="column is-one-half">
                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <p>The system is primarily designed for the average person who wants a tool to improve the organization of their closet. The people who will use this system are those who want to spend less time in the morning getting dressed, and would use this system to more efficiently choose their outfits. Users of the system will also be able to use the app to improve their style, regardless of whether or not they have previous fashion experience.</p>
                <p>In addition to average people, people who have a strong sense of style can still use this app to enhance their experience. Those people with a large collection of clothes, can utilize this system to help manage their large closets by categorizing their clothes as outfits or by creating custom labels to sort their collection. Virtual Closet will be simple enough so average users can understand it, while also including robust tools to manage large wardrobes.</p>

                    <p>Through out the development of this application I have increased my appreciation for and developed my skills in SOLID principles and Agile design. There is an art and skill to applying them correctly, but when learnt and applied, they do wonders at developing ideas and dream into functional building blocks of a larger projects. Making them integral tools in bringing this project to fruition.</p>

                    <p>Developing this application taught me a lot about how to use Git and work together as a team, and opened my eyes up to the importance of structure when it comes to building a project. By having a concrete plan of what features to prioritize, what features we were building in the future, and what interactions these features would need to function, we avoided a great deal of technical debt and tedious refactoring.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Postmortem</h1>
        <p>In the iteration 2 retrospective, we identified communicating when someone completed a task or needed assistance with a task as an issue. This improved in iteration 3 as everyone made an effort to let the other members of the team know when changes were made or assistance was needed.
        </p><br/><h2 class="subtitle is-5">If we started over…</h2><p>
        If we had the chance to start over, we would re-estimate the amount of time required for each feature. We overestimated almost all of our features as we didnt know how android studio worked.
    </p><br/><h2 class="subtitle is-5"> Project Evolution</h2>
        <p>During the planning process, we had too many features scheduled to be completed in each iteration which lead to at least 1 feature needing to be moved in each iteration. This was mainly because we planned for each team member to complete a feature but didnt plan for someone to do the documentation, tests and Git management. We also re-evaluated the priorities of the features in iteration 2 as we had a better understanding about what was feasible to accomplish in android studio.
        </p><br/><h2 class="subtitle is-5"> What took the most time:</h2>
        <p> During the early stages of planning, we had discussed doing a notification feature. However, this ended up being more difficult than expected as it needed to be moved from iteration 1 where it was scheduled, to the future. The information we found about how to implement notifications in android studio was for an older version, so it was difficult to translate to the version we were currently using. In iteration 2, we didn't have a place to integrate the notifications in. In iteration 3 there were unforeseen conflicts integrating the notification feature and subsequently testing it, so it was moved to the future.
        </p><br/><h2 class="subtitle is-5">  What we learned about project dev:</h2>
        <p>  Completing this project taught us that if 2 features need to be in the same form, it’s best if the same person does both of those features, otherwise there is too much time wasted waiting for each other to complete the feature. It also taught us that communication is key to a successful project.  If we were to work on another project together, we would start doing more scrum meetings where we reported on the code completed that day and problems we were having.
