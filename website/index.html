    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Vision statement</h3>
    <p>Virtual Closet is an app that allows people to view and organize the clothes and outfits in their closet from their mobile device. The app will organize the user’s clothing and outfits by categories such as style, colour, and seasonal trends. The app also allows users to create outfits based on clothes in their virtual closet.</p>
    <p>The system is currently being designed as a mobile application, so people will be able to create, manage, or view their virtual closet, from anywhere they go.</p>

<h3>Intended users</h3>
<p>The system is primarily designed for the average person who wants a tool to improve the organization of their closet. The people who will use this system are those who want to spend less time in the morning getting dressed, and would use this system to more efficiently choose their outfits.</p>

<p>In addition to average people, people who have a strong sense of style can still use this app to enhance their experience. Those people with a large collection of clothes, can utilize this system to help manage their large closets by categorizing their clothes as outfits or by creating custom labels to sort their collection. Virtual Closet will be simple enough so average users can understand it, while also including robust tools to manage large wardrobes.</p>

<h3>Major functionality</h3>
<p>Clothing</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sort clothing by custom tags</li>
  <li>Add and remove clothing items</li>
  <li>Change clothing icon and tags</li>
</ul>
<p>Outfits</p>

  <li>Log in to access data associated with account</li>
  <li>Edit username, password, and icon</li>
</ul>

<h4>Asia Miyai</h4>
<p>Working on this app taught me how to manage large software projects. This included practising how to implement Agile design and SOLID principles to ensure that the code is flexible when things need to change, as well as learning the importance of teamwork. Good organisation and communication are critical to the success of a project like this.</p>
<h4>Mitchel Aguilera</h4>
<h4>Alborz Khakbazan</h4>
<p>Developing this application taught me a lot about how to use Git and work together as a team, and opened my eyes up to the importance of structure when it comes to building a project. By having a concrete plan of what features to prioritise, what features we were building in the future, and what interactions these features would need to function, we avoided a great deal of technical debt and tedious refactoring.

<h4>Xiaohong Zhou (Leo)</h4>
<p>Developing this application taught me how to work with a team. With one of the biggest advantages of git, which is branching capabilities, we can easily distribute features among team members into different branches and then merge all work results into one branch. I learned using Espresso library with Junit to transfer written acceptance tests to system tests and to create automated testing to simulate user behaviour. </p>

<h3>Sales pitch</h3>
<p>VirtualCloset is a simple, flexible, and easy-to-use organisational tool. You wear clothes every day, and between a closet, dresser, laundry basket, washing machine, that chair in your room that accumulates clothes that you’ve worn once but don’t need to be washed yet, it's easy to lose track of parts of your wardrobe. On top of that, it can be difficult to come up with outfits that are <i>stylish</i> in the mornings before your busy day.</p>
<p>Our app can help you stay on top of your wardrobe and be your most fashionable self. It lets you keep track of all the items in your closet, from sneakers to sundresses to sweaters. Your clothes can be further categorised by their attributes, like colour or season. VirtualCloset also lets you combine items into outfits to keep track of your best style ideas.

<h2>Postmortem</h2>
<h3>What was the overall architecture of your system (particularly if it is different from the demo system)?</h3>
<h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
<h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
<p>Our team ran into a fair bit of trouble when it came to setting up databases – both in terms of the stub database and the persistent SQL database. After initially adding the ability to see a single account’s clothes in the first iteration, we went into the second iteration hoping to add the ability to modify an account’s clothes and to switch between accounts, only to find that upon switching accounts, none of the changes would be saved. It turns out that we had actually set up our stub database incorrectly, and hadn’t noticed because the features for us to be able to notice hadn’t been implemented yet. With a good bit of time spent revisiting old code, we were able to modify the app to properly implement a database and actually pass around information as it is updated. However, it did present us with our first major bit of technical debt – and taught us all lessons on why we should spend time ironing out the little details before marking features as complete. - Alborz Khakbazan

<h3>What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</h3>
<h3>How large is the project (number of methods, classes, etc)? How much of this is (roughly) devoted to each major system component? And any other quantifiables (e.g. if you have a record of hours spent on tasks).</h3>
<h3>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</h3>
<h3>Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant design decisions?</h3>
<h3>Are there any outstanding bugs?</h3>
<h3>Did any features work better than expected?</h3>
<h3>Are you using any technologies other than what was required (e.g. JMock, GUI builders, etc.)?</h3>
<h3>Are you using any specific techniques covered in the course (TDD, pair programming, scrums, etc)?</h3>
<h3>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</h3>
<h3>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h3>
<h3>Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?</h3>
